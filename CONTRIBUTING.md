# How to contribute to the x86-64-playground project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Rails**, and instead to refer to our [security policy](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/blob/master/SECURITY.md)

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/issues)

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Contributing to the project

This project is subdivided into two distinct elements: the x86-64-playground web app, and the blink wasm module

- If you want to work on the wasm module, refer to this [getting started](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/blob/master/docs/setup.md) guide.

- If you want to work on the web-app side, check out the [webapp folder](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/tree/master/webapp)
