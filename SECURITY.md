# Reporting Security Issues

The x86-64-playground team and community take security bugs in Electron seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/robalb/x86-64-playground/security/advisories/new) tab.

The x86-64-playground team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
